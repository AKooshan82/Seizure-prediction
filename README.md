# Seizure-prediction
develop a robust method for predicting epileptic seizures using spectral entropy-based features of EEG signals.

1.4.1 Phase 1: Theoretical Foundations and Initial Data Analysis:
- Describe the dataset used, including details on subjects, channels, and recording conditions. Implement data loading,
exploration, and preprocessing steps.


1.4.2 Phase 2: Advanced Analysis and Machine Learning:
- Extract statistical and entropy-based
features from EEG epochs. Apply statistical methods to select significant features for
classification.
- Train and test Support Vector Machine (SVM) and
K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers using the selected features. Evaluate the performance of these classifiers in predicting seizures.
- Define and calculate sensitivity, specificity, and latency metrics. Compare the performance of SVM and KNN classifiers.
